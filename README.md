# Jitterplot of weight of chickens measured over time. Colors indicate different color types of the chickens, for red datapoints the type is undermined. Shapes indicate sex of the chickens.  
We made a jittrplot with the specifications named above. We see that weight increases for both sexes. We also see that male chickens are generally heavier than female chickens. There is no clear seperation in weight between blue and black chickens.
